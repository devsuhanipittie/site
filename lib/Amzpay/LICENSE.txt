If you access or use the Program Materials, you accept and agree to be bound by this License Agreement and represent that you have the authority to bind yourself or the entity you represent to this License Agreement. 1.	Program Materials; License“Program Materials” means software, software development kits, libraries, application program interfaces, documentation, sample code, templates, and related materials that an Amazon Party makes available for use in connection with an Amazon program or service (each, an "Amazon Program"). The Amazon Party that makes Program Materials available grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable license to access, use and reproduce those Program Materials solely for the purposes of developing, testing and integrating with Your Site to allow access to Your customers who can sign in to Your Site using their Amazon account credentials and/or make payments towards Your digital and physical products (“Your Products”) as contemplated by the documentation for the applicable Program Materials. You may use Program Materials only in connection with the Amazon Program for which they are made available, unless the documentation for the applicable Program Materials authorizes broader use. If the Program Materials include any libraries, sample code, or other materials we make available specifically for incorporation in Your Products (as indicated by the applicable documentation), you may incorporate those materials in Your Products and reproduce and distribute those Program Materials as incorporated in Your Products. You may also modify any such sample code to the extent necessary to incorporate it in Your Products. We may modify or discontinue (including by ceasing our distribution of or support for) any or all of the Program Materials at any time without notice and you are solely responsible for ensuring that Your Products function properly after any such modification or discontinuation. For the purpose of this License Agreement, "Your Site" means the website or any other application controlled and/or operated by You on which Your Products are listed and offered for sale.2.	LimitationsYou may use the Program Materials only as expressly authorized under this License Agreement only for the purpose of developing, testing, and promoting Your Products as permitted by Section 1, and only through the interfaces and functionality we designate. You must comply with all instructions and requirements in any integration documents, guidelines, or other documentation that we provide. Except as permitted under Section 1, you will not (a) incorporate or compile any portion of the Program Materials into Your Products or other digital or physical products, (b) distribute, sub-license or otherwise provide any portion of the Program Materials to any third party, or (c) modify or create derivative works of the Program Materials. You will not reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile the Program Materials. You will not use the Program Materials with any software or other materials that are subject to licenses or restrictions (e.g., open source software licenses) that, when combined with the Program Materials, would require us to disclose, license, distribute or otherwise make all or any part of such Program Materials available to anyone. You will not remove, modify, or obscure any copyright, patent, trademark or other proprietary or attribution notices on or in any Program Materials. All licenses granted to you in this License Agreement are conditional on your continued compliance with this License Agreement, and will immediately and automatically terminate if you do not comply with any term or condition of this License Agreement. 3.	Reservation of Rights; Other LicensesThe Program Materials are the intellectual property of Amazon or its licensors. Except for the rights explicitly granted to you in this License Agreement, all right, title and interest in and to the Program Materials are reserved and retained by us and our licensors. If you provide suggestions, ideas, or other feedback to us about the Program Materials, we will be free to exercise all rights in such feedback without restriction and without compensating you. The Program Materials may include or be distributed with software or other materials that are provided under a separate license agreement (such as an open source license), and that separate license will govern the use of such software or other materials in the event of a conflict with this License Agreement. Any such separate license agreement may be indicated in the license, notice, or readme files distributed with the applicable software or other materials or in related documentation. 4.

THESE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS APPLY EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 5.	IndemnificationYou release us and will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Amazon and its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents against any claim, loss, damage, settlement, cost, expense or other liability (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) arising from or related to (a) Your Products or (b) your breach or non-compliance with this License Agreement (each, a "Claim"). You will not consent to the entry of a judgment or settle a Claim without our prior written consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld. You will use counsel reasonably satisfactory to us to defend each Claim. If we reasonably determine that a Claim might adversely affect us, we may take control of the defense at our expense (and without limiting your indemnification obligations).
